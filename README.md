## Background

This project analyzes movie data to generate actionable insights for Microsoft's new venture into the movie production space. This is achieved by exploring the landscape of studios, successful movie genres, and details of those movies.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

### Three Deliverables:
1. [GitHub repository](https://github.com/christiantsui/Movie-Data-Exploratory-Analysis)
2. [Jupyter Notebook](student.ipynb)
3. [Non-technical presentation](Flatiron_Project_1.pdf)

# Exploration Questions

## 1. Who are Microsoft's Competitors and What is the Production Budget of their Movies?
This question investigates Microsoft's competitors in the movie production space. The purpose of this question is to get an idea of the competitive landscape, and production budget of other successful companies. This serves as a benchmark and initial starting point for Microsoft's movie strategy.
 
### Hypothesis
- Companies that have a higher production budget tend to have more monetary success in the box office


## 2. What Genre of Movies are Most Successful in the Box Office?
This question explores the relationship between genre, and Box Office success. If there is an indication that certain genres tend to perform better in the box office, Microsoft should allocate their resources to developing movies within that space.

### Hypothesis
- Action and Adventure movies tend to perform better in the box office

## 3. What are the Metrics Associated with the Best Performing Genres?
This question explores the metrics behinf the best performing genres. If there are certain metrics of those genres that are associated with the best performing movies, then Microsoft should aim to satisfy those metrics.

### Hypothesis
- movies that are longer in runtime perform worse
