#### Oct, 2023

## Background

This project analyzes movie data to generate actionable insights for Microsoft's new venture into the movie production space. This is achieved by exploring the landscape of studios, successful movie genres, and details of those movies.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

### Three Deliverables:
1. [GitHub repository](https://github.com/christiantsui/Movie-Data-Exploratory-Analysis)
2. [Jupyter Notebook](student.ipynb)
3. [Non-technical presentation]()

# Exploration Questions

## 1. Which Movie Genres are Most Successful?
This question investigates which movie genres are most successful, through different measures of "success" beyond gross revenue. Academy Award nominations are widely accepted as a reliable measure of a film's quality, so we decided to include Oscar Nomination data in the analysis.
If the data suggests that certain movie genres tend to receive more nominations or generate a higher gross revenue, "Microsoft" should invest more in producing films of those genres.

 
### Hypothesis
- Family and Action movies are most successful in the Box Office
- Drama movies get more Oscar nominations



## 2. How Does a Movie Trailer Impact Box Office Success?
This question explores the relationship between movie budget, and Box Office success. A portion of movie budget is spent on marketing efforts, such as the movie trailer. If there is a relationship between movie trailer popularity and Box Office success, this could indicate that marketing efforts (such as movie trailers) have a significant impact on revenue, and that "Microsoft" should place a higher importance on investing resources into movie trailers for their future movies.
### Hypothesis
- movies with higher production budgets tend to have a higher return-on-investment
- movies with highly-viewed trailers tend to be more successful in the box office

## 3. How Does Movie Soundtrack Relate to Box Office Success?
This question explores the relationship between movie soundtrack ratings and online ratings/Box Office success of a movie. If there is a relationship between soundtrack rating and movie success, this suggests that a good soundtrack is common among successful movies, and Microsoft should invest resources into music score production for their movies.
### Hypothesis
- movies with highly-rated music scores tend to be more successful in the box office
